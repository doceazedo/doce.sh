Everything is inside a box. This is still true for my website, but you can notice how the elements on the hero on my home page are placed almost randomly or organically. Below it, my projects are also very much not inside a card. This is a constant work in progress of thinking outside the box... literally.</p>",

I still really wanted to better highlight my projects tho, because I'm working on stuff I'm really proud of and want to make it more clear that I work with more than just the web.</p><p><b>It should be fun.</b> Something I always loved about my website was hiding easter eggs and fun interactions.
