It is the Tin Man, protagonist of the music video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP3j6hgS4VY" target="_blank">Na Sua Estante</a> by Pitty.

I\'ve been wanting to tattoo something that refers to her songs since I first heard the <a href="https://album.link/br/i/612448612" target="_blank">Electra Heart</a> album. With the release of the flawless <a href="https://album.link/br/i/1562845738" target="_blank">Ancient Dreams in a Modern Land</a> now in 2021, I felt inspired to finally immortalize one of her artworks in my body.',
      "My most recent one (which I made with the previous one) is Napstablook, a character from the indie game Undertale, one of the few games that captured my interest. He is a melancholic ghost that likes music, and judging by my other tattoos, it's easy to notice that I identify a lot with him."
